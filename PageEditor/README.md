#Page Editor
The page editor for the standardized site builder framework.The

The page editor is implemented in TypeScript and uses jQuery for DOM manipulation and
traversal.

A drang-n-drop interface is used to allow users to drop components into the page they
are editing. Currently, the editor and many of the components that can be dropped in
are designed to implement material design through the MaterializeCSS framework, but
eventually the editor will be able to be modified to work with any styling.
