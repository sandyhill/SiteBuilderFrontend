The FilePicker is used to pick media files to be used in Pages and Posts. It's proper function
is dependent on the existance of the media file backend, which as of the time of writing (06/14/16)

The FilePicker is also used to upload files into the SiteBuilder's GCS storage. Files can be
uploaded from the user's computer, pulled from a URL, or transfered from Google Drive, DropBox,
